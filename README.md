# Clock Panel Plugin for Grafana

The Clock Panel show the current time and updates every second.

## Installation

Use the new grafana-cli tool to install clock-panel from the commandline:

```
grafana-cli plugins install clock-panel
```

The plugin will be installed into your grafana plugins directory; the default is /var/lib/grafana/plugins if you installed the grafana package.

More instructions on the cli tool can be found [here](http://docs.grafana.org/v3.0/plugins/installation/).

You need the lastest grafana build for Grafana 3.0 to enable plugin support. You can get it here : http://grafana.org/download/builds.html
